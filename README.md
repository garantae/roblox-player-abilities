# About

A player is able to receive power-ups through collecting ability crystals that spawn at random locations over a random period of time. Power-ups are collected at random, with a unique value corresponding to each ability. The client will then receive the collected ability's data, such as its name and image. When the player decides to use it, they are able to interact with the ability button that will send a RemoteEvent request to the server which will allow the server to carry out what the ability does.

# Function

* Spawn ability crystals in random spawns over a random range of time.
* Give a random ability to the player that picked up an ability crystal.
* Send information regarding the ability to the client (name, image, etc.)
* Server executes the ability's function upon player request.
